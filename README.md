# jampgame-proxy-rs

Proxy between the server engine and the game module of the game STAR WARS™
Jedi Knight - Jedi Academy™. This is the Rust rewrite of
[jampgame_proxy](https://github.com/VincentMarnier/jampgame_proxy), which
itself extends yberion's original work
[JKA_YBEProxy](https://github.com/Yberion/JKA_YBEProxy).

The proxy is a drop-in replacement for the game module `jampgamei386.so`: the
engine loads it, it transparently forwards everything to the original module,
and adds features and security hardening on top.

## Features

**Built-in security hardening** (always active):

- `getstatus` flood protection (`ipAuthorize`/DDoS removal)
- q3infoboom exploit guard
- bugged-model force and model path length clamp
- anti-cheat kicks, forcepowers validation
- `\r\n`/`;` command injection blocking in client messages and chat
- download path validation

**Optional features** (cvars):

| cvar                                  | default | description                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `proxy_sv_enableRconCmdCooldown`      | 0       | set a cooldown on RCON commands to avoid it being flooded                                       |
| `proxy_sv_maxCallVoteMapRestartValue` | 60      | maximum value allowed on a `callvote map_restart`                                               |
| `proxy_sv_modelPathLength`            | 64      | maximum model path length accepted from clients                                                 |
| `proxy_sv_enableNetStatus`            | 0       | compute and make accessible the players network status (`netStatus`/`showNet` commands)         |
| `proxy_sv_antiHpTeller`               | 0       | prevents HP tellers usage                                                                       |
| `proxy_sv_minJumpTime`                | 0       | minimum time (in ms) a player should be allowed to jump (anti low-jump scripting)               |

Note: this Rust version deliberately drops some cvars present in the original
C++ proxy (`proxy_sv_pingFix`, `proxy_sv_antiWallHack`, `proxy_sv_sabersFps`,
`proxy_sv_disableKillCmd`) — see `docs/decisions/0002-scope.md`.

## Usage

1. Rename the original `jampgamei386.so` of your server's gamedir to
   `jampgame_original.so`.
2. Get or build the proxy (see below) and put it in the place of the original
   `jampgamei386.so`.
3. Start the server as usual — the proxy loads the original module itself.

## How it works?

`linuxjampded` loads the proxy and uses it as any `jampgamei386.so`. The proxy
forwards all `vmMain` calls and game traps to `jampgame_original.so`. It hooks
selected engine and game functions (entry detours, call-site retargets and
inline patches) to inject its features without rewriting the original game
module, and reads the engine's memory layer (`serverStatic_t`/`server_t`,
cvar slots) to implement cvars and the net-status table.

```
linuxjampded ──dlopen──> jampgamei386.so (proxy) ──dlopen──> jampgame_original.so
                vmMain / syscall traps forwarded both ways,
                selected functions hooked by the proxy
```

## Building

The artifact is a 32-bit (`i686`) Linux shared object; the recommended build
route is the containerised dev environment (Docker). From `rust/`:

```sh
./dev.sh sh ./scripts/build.sh      # -> ./jampgamei386.so
```

See [`rust/README.md`](rust/README.md) for the full build, test and run
instructions (end-to-end engine test, persistent bot server).

## Project notes

- The original C++ proxy is not part of this repository; its source lives at
  <https://github.com/VincentMarnier/jampgame_proxy> (pinned commit
  `687997412ea6e5ead93f5c7b25db552590a2eeb1`).
- `docs/` holds the reverse-engineering evidence, the architecture notes and
  the decisions taken during the port. `AGENTS.md` records the project rules.
- Feel free to open an issue or a PR if you want to see anything added to it.
